My name is Dinah (dye-nah) and I love all things computer science. I'm currently
learning full stack development, practicing problem solving daily on LeetCode,
and studying for the AWS Cloud Practictioner certification.  

Outside of programming, I love to travel, outdoor activities, and learning about economics.  

Feel free to email me, or let's connect on LinkedIn or Twitter!  

Cheers.
