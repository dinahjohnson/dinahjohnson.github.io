My name is Dinah (dye-nah) and I love all things computer science. I'm currently
learning full stack development, practicing problem solving for interview prep,
and studying for the AWS Cloud Practictioner certification.  

Outside of programming, I love to travel, outdoor activities, and learning about economics.
I look forward to landing my first full time developer job in 2022 and meeting more
people in tech.  

Feel free to email me, or let's connect on LinkedIn or Twitter!

Cheers.
