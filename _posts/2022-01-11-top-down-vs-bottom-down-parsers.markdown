In the compilation process, a parser takes lexemes from the lexical analysis phase to determine their syntax structure according to the given rules of the grammar. There are 2 categories of parsers: top-down parsers and bottom-up parsers.  

## Top-down parsers

Top-down parsers build parse trees from the root downward to the leaves in preorder (each node is visited first and then its branches are explored). The most common top-down parsing algorithms are in the LL algorithm family. LL algorithms scan the input from left-to-right and specify the leftmost derivation generated.  

One example of a top-down parser is a recursive descent parser which is coded directly from the Backus-Naur description of the language syntax.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Simplicity | Doesn‚Äôt allow left recursion      |
| Easy to Code   | Ambiguity (can result in more than 1 parse tree from the same string)        |

An example of top-down parsing given the following assignment statement:

## Bottom-up parsers

Bottom-up parsers build the tree from the leaves upward to the root. A bottom-up parser takes a sentential form ùõº and determines its handle, which is a substring of ùõº, to determine which rule must
be reduced to its left-hand side (LHS) to produce the previous sentential form.  

Commonly used bottom-up parsing algorithms are in the LR family which performs a left-to-right scan and specifies the rightmost derivation generated. One example is the shift-reduce algorithm.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Can detect syntax errors quicky | Difficult to produce an LR parsing table by hand |
| Can be built for all programming languages   | Complex ‚Äì difficult to customize |
| More powerful than top-down parsers | Difficult to identify the unique handle of a sentential form if more than one production rule reduces the handle to its preceding sentential form |

Here's an example of bottom-up parsing given the following grammar and right sentinel:

*Grammar*

S ‚Üí AB | BC | cB  
A ‚Üí Ac | aBB | b  
B ‚Üí Cb | cBb | a  
C ‚Üí Ac | bCA | c  

*String*
