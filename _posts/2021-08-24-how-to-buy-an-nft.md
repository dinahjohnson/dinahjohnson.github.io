The NFT market is on fire right now, and while it's never a good idea to get involved due to FOMO, it is a good idea to learn about a new industry so that when you're ready to buy you know the basics.  

## What are NFTs?
Most people know that NFT stands for non-fungible token. But what does that actually mean? Simply put, it's a unique digital asset. Digital assets can be digital art, collectibles, videos, memes, and more. What makes it unique is each NFT has a unique token ID. When you buy an NFT its unique token ID is registered to your wallet address in a transaction that is permanently stored on the blockchain, giving you ownership of the asset. If you decide to sell or give your NFT to someone, then ownership will transfer to their wallet address.  

For NFT critics who argue that assets such as digital art or memes can just be copied for free, I encourage you to look deeper into the growing network of artists who are finally able to make money in the NFT space. Artists who sell digital art on the blockchain not only have their name permanently attached as the creator, but they can implement a smart contract that allows the artist to get a percentage of **every** sale of their artwork. So, if I buy an NFT from an artist and later sell it for profit (which I have), the original artist profits from my original purchase AND from the resale and from every subsequent resale.   

## Getting Started
To buy an NFT, first you need to decide which blockchain network you want to buy it on. So far I've bought NFTs on Ethereum and Solana. The process is simliar, but there are a few things you need to know about each.  

### Buying NFTs on Ethereum
The easiest way to buy NFTs on Ethereum is to:
1. **Open a MetaMask wallet.**  
   Go to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to set up a hot wallet. (Quick recap: a hot wallet is a wallet for blockchain assets that is connected to the internet - for more information on how to securely manage crypto wallets read [Seed Phrase Do's and Don'ts](https://cybergirldinah.github.io/seed-phrases/)). You will need to buy ETH, the Ethereum cryptocurrency, to add it to MetaMask. You can do this directly from MetaMask, but some banks don't allow crypto purchases from Wyre, the payment processor MetaMask uses for converting USD to ETH. Alternatively, you can create an account on Coinbase, a trusted exchange where you can buy most cryptocurrencies. Once you buy ETH on Coinbase, open your MetaMask wallet and click Send/Receive to obtain the public wallet address for receiving ETH. Make sure you copy it exactly! On Coinbase, press Send/Receive, choose Ethereum, enter the amount, then enter your MetaMask public address to send your ETH to your MetaMask wallet.<br><br>
  It's important to note that there are fees for each transaction, often referred to as gas, and they go up or down depending on the amount of activity on the blockchain network. Purchasing and transferring ETH incurs a small for each transaction and using ETH to buy and NFT incurs an even bigger fee. To track real-time Ethereum gas data use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).<br><br>
2. **Go to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) to buy NFTs.**  
   OpenSea is the largest NFT markeplace for Ethereum NFTs. You can browse, search for specific artists, filter by price, favorite, place bids, and buy NFTs all on OpenSea. Allow OpenSea to access your MetaMask wallet so that you can complete transactions. When buying NFTs on OpenSea it helps to find the developer/developer team's website, Twitter, and Discord. One of the best ways to find NFTs that can be flipped for profit is to join the Discord community for the project. A large community with strong engagement from supporters is usually a good sign. It's also a good idea to keep up with the NFT space on Twitter. Although there will be many people shilling useless projects, there will also be announcements about worthy projects on Twitter. The best way to make money reselling NFTs is to find a popular project, join the Discord, buy the NFT when the project launches (usually straight from the creator website), then resell it on OpenSea at a higher price to people who didn't get one during the launch. These types of projects usually only release a set number of NFTs per collection so if they're in high demand the resell value will go up. Also, rarity traits matter with these types of projects. The NFTs with rare attributes (which can be found in the description), sell for a higher price. Use [Rarity.tools](https://rarity.tools/) to evaluate how rare an NFT is before you buy.  

   There are other NFT websites where you can buy amazing NFTs, such as [Rarible](https://rarible.com/), [SuperRare](https://superrare.com/), and [Foundation](https://foundation.app/).<br> 
3. **List your NFT for sale or transfer it to a cold wallet for safe storage.**  
Once you buy an NFT the rest is up to you. If you want to resell it, the easiest place would again be OpenSea since it's the largest marketplace. Be warned that when you list an NFT for sale there is a fee associated with that transaction because it has to be registered on the blockchain if it does sell. Make sure you know how much you want to sell it for because if you change your mind you have to pay another fee to delist it, change the price, then relist it. Always keep some extra ETH in your wallet when buying/selling NFTs for fees, but don't leave too much in it because hot wallets can be vulnerable to attack (again, read [Seed Phrase Do's and Don'ts](https://cybergirldinah.github.io/seed-phrases/) for information about keeping your assets secure). If you plan to keep your NFT long term to see if the value will appreciate, I recommend transferring it to a cold wallet like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) for safe storage.  

### Buying NFTs on Solana
Solana is newer to the NFT game than Ethereum, so the infrastructure isn't quite as polished, but the transaction fees are significantly lower which makes it especially attractive to new participants in blockchain. The process is just like Ethereum except different currency and websites:  

1. **Set Up a Phantom wallet.**  
   This is just like setting up MetaMask but instead go to [Phantom](https://phantom.app/). Buy SOL, the cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, on Coinbase. Get your Phantom wallet receive address, then send your SOL from Coinbase to Phantom.<br><br>
2. **Go to Solanart to buy NFTs.**  
   The NFT marketplace for Solana is [Solanart](https://solanart.io/). The website is still in Beta so there's room for improvement but it still functions for what you need. I bought a [Degen Ape](https://solanart.io/collections/degenape) the night of launch and even with Solanart not loading images I managed to sell it for a significant profit. Solana is becoming more and more attractive to people who don't want to pay Ethereum gas, so while they're still working out the kinks in their technology, I think the long term potential for NFTs on Solana is good.<br><br>
3. **Check your Phantom wallet for your NFT purchase.**  
   Once you buy an NFT on Solanart it will appear in your Phantom wallet. You can resell it on Solanart or transfer it to a cold wallet to hold long term. Of course you can also leave it in Phantom but since it's a hot wallet just like MetaMask it's vulnerable to hackers.  

It may seem like a lot, but once you get your wallet set up it's easy from there on because then you can skip the initial set up part. All you have to do is fund your crypto wallet, find your favorite marketplace, and buy/sell NFTs as much as you like. As far as tips on what NFTs to buy, I try to avoid giving that type of advice. It's an extremely volatile market and there's no guarantee how an NFT will perform in short term nor in the long term. Instead, here's a couple tips and a few Twitter accounts I follow that give good information:

## Tips
 - Avoid following people who make their entire living from social media marketing because they often get paid to promote projects but they rarely investigate the fundamentals
 - Always visit the website for the project. Is their developer team listen? What are their long term plans for their NFT community? What is their roadmap for those plans?
 - Join the Discord for the project you're interested in - especially projects that have upcoming launches. Try to gauge enthusiam about the project

Hopefully this guide provided everything you need to know about how to buy and sell NFTs. There is much more to the NFT space, like gaming collectibles and fractional ownership, which I hope to cover in the future. NFTs are a fun introduction to blockchain and a remarkable tool for artists and creators. Just remember to only spend what you can afford to lose and, most importantly, have fun.
