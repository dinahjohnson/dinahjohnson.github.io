After seeing numerous crypto and NFT holders fall for the infamous "enter your seed phrase" scam, I thought I'd share some tips on how to securely manage your seed phrase.  

If you're new to the blockchain space, a seed phrase is a series of words that lets you access the cryptocurrency or NFTs on a crypto wallet. When you initially set up a wallet you will be given a randomized seed phrase along with the instructions to NEVER GIVE AWAY YOUR SEED PHRASE. Tattoo this in your brain! Seriously, never give away your seed phrase.  

There are two types of crypto wallets, hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are always connected to the internet and accessed via a browser or browser extension. You usually add a password after writing down your seed phrase. If and only if you forget your password, then you will have to enter your seed phrase to access your hot wallet again and set up a new password. This is the only instance where you should need to enter your seed phrase for a hot wallet: only if you forgot your password. If this happens, always triple check to make sure you are on the correct website. I can't tell you how many people have been scammed by going to Metamask.com instead of the correct website which is [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/) when trying to access their Ethereum hot wallet.  

A cold wallet is a device you connect to your computer (or via Bluetooth for newer cold wallets) so that you can transfer your crypto or NFTs to and from a hot wallet or exchange. It's a storage for holding cryptocurrency that you're not planning on using to trade or spend. A cold wallet can and should be stored safely in your home or in a safety deposit box, and you should refrain from letting anyone know you have one. If you wish send or receive crypto on your cold wallet, then you will connect your cold wallet to your computer, enter your seed phrase into the application that manages your cold wallet (which you should always download directly from the manufacturer's website to avoid dupes) to access to your holdings. There is never any other reason to enter a seed phrase for a cold wallet anywhere else. And please, never buy a cold wallet from a 3rd party vendor, not even from Amazon. Buy it directly from the manufacturer. Most people use [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) cold wallets.  

It's important to note that legitimate companies will never contact you first telling you that you forgot your password and need to enter your seed phrase. Also, crypto holders who wish to send you cryptocurrency or an NFT will never ask for your seed phrase. Instead they will ask for your **public address**. A wallet address is a randomly generated series of numbers and letters which you use to send and receive cryptocurrency. The address is generated when you click the send/receive button on the software used to access your wallet.  

The great thing about blockchain is that your public wallet address can be shared securely and all transactions to and from that address can be viewed on a blockchain explorer without compromising your identity or holdings. If you do mess up and give your seed phrase to a scammer (please don't!) you can search for your wallet's address on the blockchain explorer to the view entire history of transactions. Unfortunately if this does happen it means you have to suffer through watching the scammer transfer your assets out of your wallet and there isn't really anything you can do once it's gone. If you give your seed phrase to an illegitamte company or a scammer you are essentially giving away your money and property with little to no chance of recovery.  

**Where** you write down your seed phrase is equally important because if you lose it you can't access your assets. Manufacturers of cold wallets do not store seed phrases to ensure they can't be stolen in the event of a hack. Most wallets, hot and cold, do not require personal information from the customer so it would be nearly impossible to prove a wallet belongs to you if you are trying to recover locked assets. Never lose your seed phrase!

It's not a good idea to store your seed phrase on a device connected to the internet, because as we all know everything is hackable. It's also not a good idea to write your seed phrase down on a random piece of paper you leave lying around. Some good places to write down your seed phrase are:  

 - On the back of a picture kept inside of a frame  
 - Inside a hardcover book on a specific page you'll remember (keep the book on a shelf with plenty of other books)  
 - On a piece of paper kept in a safe (as long as the safe is well hidden in the event of a break in)  
 - In a password manager if you prefer an online solution and you're excellent about maintaining password security (Try [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/))
  
Places to avoid writing down your seed phrase:  
- In a notes app on your phone  
- On a sticky note or scrap of paper on your desk  
- In an email to yourself  
- In a text message to yourself  
- In a notebook or journal that you frequently take with you ouside your home  

Hopefully this post gave you some good ideas, or at the very least I hope it scared you into taking your seed phrase security very seriously. The last thing I want to do is discourage anyone new from entering the blockchain space because it's a very exciting time to get involved. Just make sure that when you do you protect yourself and your assets.
