After seeing numerous crypto and NFT holders fall for the infamous "enter your seed phrase" scam I thought I'd share some tips on what to do and what not to do with your seed phrase.  

If you're new to the blockchain space, a seed phrase is a series of words that lets you access the cryptocurrency or NFTs on your wallet. When you initially set up a wallet you will be given a randomized seed phrase along with the instructions to NEVER GIVE AWAY YOUR SEED PHRASE. For hot wallets, which are wallets connected to the internet such as Metamask on the Ethereum network or Phantom on the Solana network, you can set a password after writing down your seed phrase. If and only if you forget your password you can enter your seed phrase to access your hot wallet again and set up a new password. Just triple check to make sure you are on the correct website!  

The most important thing to note is legitimate companies will NEVER contact you first telling you that you forgot your password and need to enter your seed phrase. Also, legitimate crypto holders who wish to send you cryptocurrency or an NFT will NEVER ask for your seed phrase. Instead they will ask for your public address. The great thing about blockchain is that your public wallet address can be viewed, along with all the transactions to and from that address, without compromising your identity or holdings. However, if you give up your seed phrase to an illegitamte company or a scammer you are essentially giving away your money and property with little to no chance of recovery.  

The same applies for a cold wallet, which is a device you connect to your computer (or via Bluetooth for newer cold wallets) so that you can transfer your crypto or NFTs from a hot wallet or exchange and into a more secure device. A cold wallet can and should be stored safely in your home or in a safe deposit box, and you should refrain from letting anyone know you have one. If you wish to add more crypto or to send crypto from your cold wallet to an exchange or hot wallet so that you can use it, then you will connect your cold wallet to your computer, enter your seed phrase into the application that manages your cold wallet (which you should always download directly from the manufacturer's website to avoid dupes) which will grant you access to your holdings. There is never any other reason to enter a seed phrase for a cold wallet anywhere else.  

Where you write down your seed phrase is equally important because once lost you can't recover your holdings. Access to that wallet is likely lost forever. For this reason it's not a good idea to store your seed phrase on a device connected to the internet, because as we all know everything is hackable (even blockchain...). It's also not a good idea to write your seed phrase down on a random piece of paper you leave lying around because it can get lost. 

Some good places to write down your seed phrase are:

 - On the back of a picture kept inside of a frame  
 - Inside a hardcover book on a specific page you'll remember (keep the book on a shelf with plenty of other books)    
 - On a piece of furniture or foundation. Crazy I know, but think inside the bathroom cabinet or somewhere not visible to guests. Maybe a closet wall that stays covered by clothes  
 - On a piece of paper kept in a safe (as long as the safe is well hidden in the event of a break in)  
 - In a password manager if you prefer an online solution and you're excellent about maintaining password security. Try LastPass  
  
Some terrible places to write down your seed phrase are:  
- In a notes app on your phone  
- On a sticky note on your desk  
- In an email to yourself  
- In a text message to yourself  
- In a notebook or journal that you frequently use  

Hopefully this post gave you some good ideas, or at the very least I hope if scared you into taking your seed phrase security very seriously. The last thing I want to do is discourage anyone because blockchain is amazing and it's a very exciting time to get involved, just make sure that when you do you protect yourself and your assets.
