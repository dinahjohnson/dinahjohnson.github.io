<p> Hi! I'm Dinah (pronounced dye-nah). I'm a recent computer science graduate and lover of all things tech. I'm a web and mobile app developer and blockchain researcher. Right now I develop for Web2 but I'm learning Solidity and blockchain development in the hopes of moving to Web3 development. I write about blockchain to simplify concepts for a non-technical audience and to encourage more people to get involved in this exciting space.</p><br>
