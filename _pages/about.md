<p>Hi! I'm Dinah (pronounced dye-nah). I'm a recent computer science graduate and lover of all things tech. I started this blog to review the essential fundamentals of computer science so that I can properly assess the strengths and weaknesses of "buzzword" technologies. Is blockchain really going to take over the world? How does Web3 differ from Web2? Are AI and machine learning prone to human bias?  <br><br>
  
I hope to learn the answers to these questions and more, and I believe the best way to move forward is by learning from the past. </p>
